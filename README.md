# weed_classifier

Using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/fpeccia/weed-detection-in-soybean-crops) dataset on weeds we build a neural network from scratch using only numpy to detect different sorts of weed. To use on your local machine, please download the repository as well as the dataset from kaggle. Place the dataset in the same folder as the jupyter notebook to run the code.
